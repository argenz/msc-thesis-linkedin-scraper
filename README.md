# Linkedin Scraper
This repository contains the code used to scrape 40K LinkedIn profile data for my MSc Thesis in August 2022.

- linkedin-scraper: src folder that contains the actual scraping code.
- abw-docker-deployer: folder that contains Dockerfile and a file to automate the builds and deployment of containers that I used to parallelize the processes on my local machine and speed up scraping.

This setup was chose because all major cloud providers IPs are banned from LinkedIn servers to prevent this activity.
